# Balance-3D
My first game. It was created as a copy of the old computer game "Balance".
In it I used the following technologies:
  1. Physics (drag, rigidbody, colliders, triggers, addforce).
  2. Interaction of the ball with triggers, such as pick up coins, saving to checkpoint, pick up speed boost, pushing boxes.
  3. Building level using addon ProBuilder
  4. Animator, hand-maded animations.
  5. Obstacles
  6. Audio Mixer
  7. Volume sliders, preview screen
